    <p>You are a wildlife photographer on an expedition deep in the Amazon rainforest. While setting up your camera trap, you receive a strange radio message:</p>
    <p>"Explorer, we found footprints of a creature no one has ever seen. Come to Base Camp Bravo immediately!"</p>
    <p>You were planning to finally photograph the rare jaguar tonight, but this mystery sounds way more exciting.</p>
    <p>What do you do? Investigate the footprints, or stay and wait for the jaguar?</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
    <p>Say "yes" when you're ready for your next big adventure!</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="err0">
    <p>Please answer yes or no.</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
    <p>You head off toward Base Camp Bravo. On the way, your canoe tips after hitting a log and all your food floats away!</p>
    <p>You're soaked, tired, and a bit nervous. But then, out of the bushes, a capybara appears with a fruit in its mouth. It drops it and stares at you.</p>
    <p>Is this a sign? Should you keep tracking the footprints even without supplies, or turn back?</p>
    <p>What will you do: follow the trail, or go back to camp?</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
    <p>You decide to stay and wait for the jaguar. Hours pass, and just as you're about to fall asleep, a golden jaguar steps into your camera’s view.</p>
    <p>You quietly snap the photo — the most stunning image you've ever taken. National Geographic calls it a masterpiece!</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="err1">
    <p>Please answer Follow the Trail or Go Back.</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
    <p>You decide to follow the trail. With help from the capybara, who seems oddly intelligent, you navigate to a hidden cave.</p>
    <p>Inside, you find glowing crystals and a carving of a creature with six legs and feathers. You snap photo after photo — this is groundbreaking!</p>
    <p>The capybara vanishes, and you find your food packed neatly near the cave exit. Mysterious, but lucky!</p>
</div>
<div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
    <p>You decide to head back to camp. As you canoe back, a sudden storm flips your canoe again, and you lose your camera and radio.</p>
    <p>You eventually return to camp, soaked and defeated. You try to tell your team about the capybara and the message, but no one believes you.</p>
    <p>At least you’re safe... and next time, you'll be ready.</p>
